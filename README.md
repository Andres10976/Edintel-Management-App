# GERMAN - Edintel Internal Management Platform

## Overview

GERMAN is an enterprise-level internal management platform developed for Edintel S.A., featuring two core modules:

1. **Expense Audit Module**: A comprehensive expense management and approval system for handling employee expense reports, including multi-level approval workflows and document management.

2. **Post-Venta Management Module**: A service ticket management system for handling post-sale technical services, including location management, ticket tracking, and technician assignment.

## To be implemented

A list of the modules that will be implemented in the future:

1. **Overtime Report Module**: This module will allows the workers to upload their overtime to be reviewed and approved.

2. **Commercial Management Module**: Pipelined Commercial department module that will allow them to easily do their work without unnecesary extra steps.

3. **In-app Post-Venta Report Forms**: Instead of using Word or Excel docs to fill up the reports, there will be in app forms to easily fill it up.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Azure AD (MSAL)
- **API Integration**: Microsoft Graph API
- **Storage**: SharePoint Lists and Document Libraries
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **File Processing**: PapaCSV, SheetJS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts

### Design Patterns & Architecture

- **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for Expense Audit and Post-Venta Management
- **Context-Provider Pattern**: For state management and module-specific data handling
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: For reusable business logic and UI behavior
- **Service Layer Pattern**: For API and data access abstraction
- **Compound Components**: For building flexible and reusable UI components

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- Azure AD integration for secure authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Protected routes and API endpoints

### Data Security

- Token-based API access
- Secure file uploads with validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- XSS protection through React and content security policies

## Performance Optimizations

- Memoization of expensive computations

## Known Limitations

- Limited offline functionality
- Dependency on SharePoint for data storage
- Calendar integration limited to group calendars
- File size limitations for uploads (20MB max)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Authentication Errors

```javascript
// Check if user is authenticated
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  navigate("/login", { state: { from: location } });
}
```

2. File Upload Issues

```javascript
// Validate file size and type
const MAX_SIZE = 20 * 1024 * 1024; // 20MB
if (file.size > MAX_SIZE) {
  throw new Error("File size exceeds limit");
}
```

3. SharePoint Access Issues

```javascript
// Verify SharePoint permissions
const { siteId } = await service.getSiteId(config.siteName);
if (!siteId) {
  throw new Error("Unable to access SharePoint site");
}
```
